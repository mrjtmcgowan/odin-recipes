    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
    <p>The tacos you can create with this recipe will beat any you've ever tried. The first step is using tortillas from a local shop.</p>
    <p>Open your phone (if you aren't already using it as you read this) and navigate yourself to a "tortilleria".</p>
    <p>If you've never been to a Latino/Mexican/Salvadoran/etc. market don't be intimmidated when you walk in. Other than having excellent produce you'll find, usually at the back of the store, a tortilleria: that magical machine that creates <b>true</b> tortillas.</p>
    <p>*Side note: the "crunchy" tacos that you might find in sad yellow boxes on the shelves of Walmart or other similar stores are <em>unacceptable for human consumption.</em></p>
    <p>Acquire the tortillas and get double the amount of tacos you're making. Acquire the other ingredients wherever you like, but you're alredy in a store so why not get some of that great produce, eh?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tortillas (20)</li>
        <li>queso blanco (Oaxaca is a good brand)</li>
        <li>black beans (Goya)</li>
        <li>yellow onion</li>
        <li>salsa verde</li>
        <li>two small avocados</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>two jalape√±os</li>
        <li>you preferred meat (chicken/beef/chorizo/etc.) or you can sub mushrooms (organic is a must here)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you've purchased all of your ingredients complete the following steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, combine the chicken, salsa, beans, onion powder, chili powder and remaining cumin. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.</li>
        <li>In an ungreased skillet, cook tortillas, one at a time, until lightly browned, about 30 seconds on each side.</li>
        <li>Layer between pieces of waxed paper or paper towel; keep warm. Spoon chicken mixture over half of each tortilla and fold over. Serve with lettuce, cheese, olives, sour cream and salsa if desired.</li>
    </ol>
